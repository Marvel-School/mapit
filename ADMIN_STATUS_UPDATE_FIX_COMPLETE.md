# ADMIN STATUS UPDATE FIX - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Resolution Summary

**PROBLEM**: Times Square destination was re-added to the database but remained with "pending approval" status. When trying to approve it through the admin panel at `http://localhost/admin/destinations`, users encountered an "Error updating status" message.

**ROOT CAUSE**: Missing route and method implementation for AJAX status updates in the admin panel.

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Added Missing Route
**File**: `config/routes.php`
- Added route: `$this->post('admin/destinations/{id}/status', 'Admin\DestinationController', 'status');`

### 2. Fixed AJAX Detection Method
**File**: `app/Controllers/Admin/DestinationController.php`
- Corrected AJAX detection from `$this->isAjaxRequest()` to `\App\Core\Request::isAjax()`
- The `status()` method was already implemented but had incorrect AJAX detection

### 3. Database Status Verified
- Times Square (ID: 17) successfully approved
- Status changed from "pending" to "approved"
- Featured flag remains: `featured = 1`
- Total approved featured destinations: 15

## 🧪 TESTING RESULTS

### Comprehensive Test Results:
```
✅ Admin login successful
✅ Admin panel access working
✅ Status update endpoint responding correctly
✅ Database updated successfully
✅ JSON response format correct
```

### Test Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Destination approved successfully", 
  "status": "approved"
}
```
