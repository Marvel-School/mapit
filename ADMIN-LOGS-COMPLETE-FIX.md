## üîß **All Issues Resolved:**

### 1. ‚úÖ **SQL WHERE Clause Error - FIXED**
- **Problem**: `Log::getPaginated()` created invalid SQL like `"SELECT * FROM logs WHERE ORDER BY..."`
- **Solution**: Rewrote WHERE clause logic to only add WHERE when conditions exist

### 2. ‚úÖ **View Layout Include Error - FIXED** 
- **Problem**: `include(../layouts/admin_header.php): Failed to open stream`
- **Solution**: Changed from direct includes to layout system: `<?php $layout = 'admin'; ?>`

### 3. ‚úÖ **Pagination Array Key Mismatch - FIXED**
- **Problem**: `Undefined array key "total_pages"` and `"current_page"`
- **Solution**: Fixed key names to match controller output (`totalPages`, `page`)
